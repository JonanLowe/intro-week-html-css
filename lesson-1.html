    <p>In 1914 Ernest Shackleton, 26 crew and 1 stowaway sailed to the Antarctic aboard <i>Endurance</i>. Their goal was to be the first people to walk across the continent. </p>

    <p>Before they could make landfall in Antarctica, <i>Endurance</i> became trapped in the sea ice, and was slowly crushed</p>

    <p><i>All hands were forced to abandon ship and make camp on the shifting ice floes, as the Antarctic winter set in. So began a 2-year struggle for survival, and Shackleton's perilous journey across ice, sea and glaciers, to find rescue. </p>
